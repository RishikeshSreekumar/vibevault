# This file makes 'app' a Python package.
# It can be empty or contain package-level initializations.

# For example, you could import the main app instance here
# from .main import app
# However, for Uvicorn, it's often easier to point directly to `app.main:app`

# You might also configure logging here or other application-wide settings.
