# For Pydantic v1, pydantic[email] is fine.
# For Pydantic v2, just 'pydantic' and ensure 'email-validator' is installed if strict email/url validation is needed,
# or rely on its built-in validation which is good for many cases.
# psycopg2-binary is for PostgreSQL connection.
# python-dotenv for loading .env files.
# alembic for database migrations.
